# R-Cholesky-Decomposition
A procedural version of the Cholesky Decomposition in R.

The Cholesky Decomposition is used to simulate correlated random variables (among other things).

The R implementation "chol()" is often error prone when using synthetic data (where linear combinations are present).
This procedural implementation avoids such errors.
